## Building a Web System for a Home Automation Company

<br/>

While expanding my expertise in software engineering, I embarked on a project to build a web system for a home automation company, CISNA SmartHome.

<br/>
<br/>

## The Challenge

<br/>

The challenge was to create a **fast**, **secure** web app that would not only provide an exceptional user experience but also showcase the company's products and services, and include a contact form for potential customers.

<br/>
<br/>

## The Solution

<br/>

I decided to use the **Next.js framework** for this project.

Here's how I utilized the technology:

<br/>

<ul class="tech-showcase">
<li class="tech-card">

### Next.js

<img src="/img/tech/next-js.svg" alt="Next.js" style="width:50%;height:50px;margin:15px 0;">
<br/>

Next.js allowed me to create an **interactive** and **responsive** UI that works flawlessly on all devices. This ensured that the customers of the company had a seamless experience whether they accessed the website on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.
<br/>
<br/>

</li>
</ul>

### Contact Form and Product Showcase

<br/>

One of the key features of the app was a contact form that allowed potential customers to reach out with inquiries. Additionally, the app showcased the company's products and services, making it easy for customers to understand what CISNA SmartHome offers.

<br/>
<br/>

## The Result

<br/>

The result was a **fast**, **secure**, and **user-friendly** web app that met all the needs of the company. They were able to showcase their products effectively and provide an exceptional user experience.
<br/>
<br/>

<div class="image-showcase">
    <img src="/img/cisna/landing.png" alt="Landing Page CISNA SmartHome" style="width:200px;height:360px;vertical-align:middle">
    <img src="/img/cisna/house.png" alt="House Page CISNA SmartHome" style="width:200px;height:360px;vertical-align:middle">
    <img src="/img/cisna/yubii.png" alt="Yubii Page CISNA SmartHome" style="width:200px;height:360px;vertical-align:middle">
</div>
<br/>

This project was a great learning experience for me and I'm proud of the result. It was a pleasure to help CISNA SmartHome with their new venture and see the app contribute to the company's success.
