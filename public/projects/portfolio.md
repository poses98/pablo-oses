## Constructing a Desktop OS Styled Web Portfolio

<br/>

During my journey as a software engineer, I embarked on a personal project to create a unique web portfolio that would showcase my skills and projects. The portfolio was designed to resemble a desktop operating system, complete with interactive windows and file visualizers.

<br/> <br/>

## The Objective

<br/>

The goal was to build a dynamic and interactive web portfolio that not only displayed my work in an engaging manner but also demonstrated my proficiency in modern web technologies. The portfolio needed to be easily updatable and capable of rendering markdown files.

<br/>
<br/>

## The Approach

<br/>

For this project, I chose to use the Next.js framework.

Here’s how I leveraged each aspect of the technology:

<br/>

<ul class=“tech-showcase”> 
<li class=“tech-card”>

Next.js and React Hooks

Next.js provided the foundation for building a dynamic and interactive web portfolio. The use of React Hooks allowed for efficient state management and component lifecycle control, ensuring a smooth user experience across all devices.

<br/>
<br/> 
</li> 
</ul>

## Automated Deployment with Vercel

<br/>

One of the key features of the portfolio was its automated deployment process. By pushing changes to a specific branch on GitHub, the portfolio would automatically update on Vercel, ensuring that the latest version of my work was always available for viewing.

<br/> <br/>
The Outcome

<br/>

The outcome was a dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly web portfolio that effectively showcased my skills and projects. The portfolio’s unique desktop OS design and interactive windows provided an engaging user experience.

<br/> <br/>

<div style=“display:flex;flex-direction:row;width:100%;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center”> 
    <img src=“/img/portfolio/landing.png” alt=“Portfolio Landing Page” style=“width:200px;height:360px;vertical-align:middle”> 
    <img src=“/img/portfolio/window.png” alt=“Portfolio Window” style=“width:200px;height:360px;vertical-align:middle”> 
    <img src=“/img/portfolio/browser.png” alt=“Portfolio Browser” style=“width:200px;height:360px;vertical-align:middle”> 
</div> 
<br/>

This project was an enriching experience for me and I’m proud of the result. It was a joy to build a platform that effectively showcases my work and skills.
