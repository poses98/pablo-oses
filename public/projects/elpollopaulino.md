## Building a Web System for a Takeout Restaurant

<br/>

While studying software engineering, I was approached by two friends who were on the verge of opening a new grilled chicken store. They needed a web system for their restaurant and trusted me to build it for them.

<br/>
<br/>

## The Challenge

<br/>

The challenge was to create a **fast** and **secure** web app that would not only provide an exceptional user experience but also allow them to change prices and also capable of sending commercial emails and allowing the user to order online.

<br/>
<br/>

## The Solution

<br/>

I decided to use the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) for this project.

Here's how I utilized each technology:

<br/>

<ul class="tech-showcase">
<li class="tech-card">

### React

<img src="/img/tech/react.svg" alt="Mongodb" style="width:50%;height:50px;margin:15px 0;">
<br/>
React allowed me to create an **interactive** and **responsive** UI that works flawlessly on all devices. This ensured that the customers of the store had a seamless experience whether they accessed the website on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.
<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li class="tech-card">

### Express.js and Node.js

<img src="/img/tech/express-js.svg" alt="Mongodb" style="width:50%;height:50px;margin:15px 0;">
<br/>
Express.js, running on Node.js, powered the backend of the application. It handled data efficiently and ensured that the app ran smoothly without any hiccups.
<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li class="tech-card">

### MongoDB

<br/>
MongoDB was used for flexible data management. It allowed the store owners to easily update prices and other details without any hassle.
<br/>
<br/>
</li>
</ul>

### Secure User Authentication and Online Ordering

<br/>

One of the key features of the app was secure user authentication. This ensured that the users' data was safe and secure. Additionally, the app boasted an easy online ordering system, making it convenient for customers to place orders.

<br/>
<br/>

## The Result

<br/>

The result was a **fast**, **secure**, and **user-friendly** web app that met all the needs of the store owners. They were able to manage their store effectively and provide an exceptional user experience serving 100k requests yearly.
<br/>
<br/>

<div class="image-showcase">
    <img src="/img/paulino/paulino-landing.png" alt="Landing Page El Pollo Paulino" style="width:200px;height:360px;vertical-align:middle">
    <img src="/img/paulino/paulino-order.png" alt="Order Page El Pollo Paulino" style="width:200px;height:360px;vertical-align:middle">
    <img src="/img/paulino/paulino-login.png" alt="Logo El Pollo Paulino" style="width:200px;height:360px;vertical-align:middle">
</div>
<br/>

This project was a great learning experience for me and I'm proud of the result. It was a pleasure to help my friends with their new venture and see the app contribute to the store's success.
