# Building a Web System for a New Store

While studying software engineering, I was approached by two friends who were on the verge of opening a new store. They needed a web system for their store and trusted me to build it for them.

## The Challenge

The challenge was to create a **fast** and **secure** web app that would not only provide an exceptional user experience but also allow them to change prices and more.

## The Solution

I decided to use the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) for this project. Here's how I utilized each technology:

### React

React allowed me to create an **interactive** and **responsive** UI that works flawlessly on all devices. This ensured that the customers of the store had a seamless experience whether they accessed the website on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.

### Express.js and Node.js

Express.js, running on Node.js, powered the backend of the application. It handled data efficiently and ensured that the app ran smoothly without any hiccups.

### MongoDB

MongoDB was used for flexible data management. It allowed the store owners to easily update prices and other details without any hassle.

### Secure User Authentication and Online Ordering

One of the key features of the app was secure user authentication. This ensured that the users' data was safe and secure. Additionally, the app boasted an easy online ordering system, making it convenient for customers to place orders.

## The Result

The result was a **fast**, **secure**, and **user-friendly** web app that met all the needs of the store owners. They were able to manage their store effectively and provide an exceptional user experience serving 100k requests yearly.

This project was a great learning experience for me and I'm proud of the result. It was a pleasure to help my friends with their new venture and see the app contribute to the store's success.
