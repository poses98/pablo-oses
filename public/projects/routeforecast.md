## Building an In-Route Weather Web Application

<br/>

Inspired by personal journeys, I envisioned and brought to life an in-route weather web application, RouteForecast, aimed to be a dependable guide for fellow travelers.

<br/>
<br/>

## The Challenge

<br/>

The challenge was to create a **fast**, **secure** web app that would not only provide an exceptional user experience but also offer accurate weather insights and precise navigation for riders.

<br/>
<br/>

## The Solution

<br/>

I decided to use the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) for this project, with Chakra UI for a visually appealing frontend.

Here's how I utilized each technology:

<br/>

### React and Chakra UI

<img src="/img/tech/react.svg" alt="React" style="width:50%;height:50px;margin:15px 0;">
<br/>

React, coupled with Chakra UI, allowed me to create an **interactive** and **responsive** UI that works flawlessly on all devices. This ensured that the users had a seamless experience whether they accessed the website on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.
<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li class="tech-card">

### Express.js and Node.js

<img src="/img/tech/express-js.svg" alt="Express.js" style="width:50%;height:50px;margin:15px 0;">
<br/>

Express.js, running on Node.js, powered the backend of the application. It handled data efficiently and ensured that the app ran smoothly without any hiccups.
<br/>
<br/>

</li>
</ul>

### Google Maps API and AEMET API

<br/>

The application integrates the precision of the **Google Maps API** for navigation and the accuracy of the **AEMET API** for weather insights. This combination provides users with reliable route planning and weather forecasting.

<br/>
<br/>

## The Result

<br/>

The result was a **fast**, **secure**, and **user-friendly** web app that met all the needs of the users. They were able to plan their routes effectively and get accurate weather forecasts.
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="display:flex;flex-direction:row;width:100%;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center">
    <img src="/img/routeforecast/landing.png" alt="Landing Page RouteForecast" style="width:200px;height:360px;vertical-align:middle">
    <img src="/img/routeforecast/route.png" alt="Route Page RouteForecast" style="width:200px;height:360px;vertical-align:middle">
    <img src="/img/routeforecast/weather.png" alt="Weather Page RouteForecast" style="width:200px;height:360px;vertical-align:middle">
</div>
<br/>

This project was a great learning experience for me and I'm proud of the result. It was a pleasure to develop RouteForecast and see the app contribute to the success of fellow riders.
